		<p>A Tokimon is a rare creature found in the remote areas of Korea. For the most part, they
resemble rabbits and the only form of communication they have with us is the ability to say
their own name. Tokimons come in all shapes and sizes, have special abilities, and tend to fight
with each other on occasion. Each Tokimon could have the ability to fly, fight, throw fire, spray
water, electrify, and freeze other Tokimons; their ability is measured by an integer between 0
and 100. Because they are such primitive creatures but have such extraordinary abilities, they
need Tokimon trainers. The trainerâ€™s is job to collect Tokimons and use them accordingly. We
would like to write an application to track the known Tokimons in existence.</p>
